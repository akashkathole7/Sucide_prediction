# Sucide_prediction

This repository contains code and resources related to predicting suicide risk using machine learning algorithms. Suicide is a serious public health issue and efforts to predict and prevent suicide are critical. By analyzing various risk factors, such as mental health history, substance abuse, and other related factors, machine learning algorithms can be trained to predict the likelihood of suicide attempts.

The purpose of this project is to provide a starting point for those interested in developing or implementing suicide prediction models. This project includes sample code and datasets to help individuals get started with building their own models.

Datasets
This project includes several datasets that can be used to train and test suicide prediction models. These datasets are publicly available and can be downloaded from reputable sources such as the National Institute of Mental Health.

Code
The code included in this project is written in Python and uses popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. The code provides examples of how to preprocess the data, split the data into training and testing sets, and build and evaluate different machine learning models. Additionally, the code includes functions for hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and visualization of model performance.

Resources
This project includes a list of resources related to suicide prevention and machine learning. These resources can be helpful for individuals looking to learn more about the topic or for those seeking additional datasets or tools to use in their own projects.

Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have suggestions for additional datasets, resources, or code examples, please submit a pull request. Additionally, please report any issues or bugs you encounter while using the code or datasets.
